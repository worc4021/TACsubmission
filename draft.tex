\documentclass[journal]{IEEEtran}
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[journal]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/epslatex/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/


\usepackage{amsthm}


% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/dblfloatfix/




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.


\usepackage{amssymb,mathrsfs}

% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/url/

% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as

\section{Problem statement}

\section{Parametrically Convex sets}
In this section we discuss \emph{parametric convexity}, an attribute of sets valued maps 
(so called point-to-set maps, see e.g.~\cite{Hogan:1973}) we exploit later on to prove 
convexity of a generalised Pontryagin difference in order to 
%
\begin{defi}[Parametric Convexity]\label{def:parametric:convexity}
  Let $X\subseteq\mathbb R^d, Y\subseteq\mathbb R^n$, let $\mathscr P(Y)$ 
  denote the power set of $Y$, 
  and $\mathcal W:X\rightarrow \mathscr P(Y)$, $X\ni p\mapsto \mathcal W(p)
  \subset Y$ be a continuous point-to-set map. The map $\mathcal W$ is called 
  \emph{parametrically convex} if it satisfies
%
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:def:parametrically:convex}
  \mathcal W(\lambda p_1 + (1-\lambda)p_2)\subseteq\lambda \mathcal W(p_1) \oplus (1-\lambda) \mathcal W(p_2)
  \end{equation}
%
  for all $p_1,p_2\in X$ and $\lambda\in[0,1]$.
\end{defi}
%
Notice that Definition~\ref{def:parametric:convexity} does not require convexity of~$\mathcal W(p)$ for all
$p\in X$, we will however only treat maps~$\mathcal W$ for which $\mathcal W(p)$ is convex.


\subsection{Abstract Properties}
%
In this subsection we introduce an equivalent characterisation of parametric 
convexity that will yield some insight on the topological 
definition~\ref{def:parametric:convexity}, for this we characterise parametric
convexity in terms of the graph of the point-to-set map.
%
\begin{defi}\label{def:graph:of:map}
Let $\mathcal W:X\rightarrow \mathscr P(Y)$ be a continuous point-to-set map
such that $\mathcal W(p)$ is convex for all $p\in X$, then 
%
\[
  \mathscr G(\mathcal W) = \{(p,x) \in\mathbb R^{d+n}: x\in\mathcal W(p)\},
\]
%
denotes the \emph{graph} of $\mathcal W$,
%
\[
  \text{int}(\mathscr G(\mathcal W)) = \{(p,x) \in\mathbb R^{d+n}: \forall d\in\mathbb R^n\;\exists 
  \epsilon>0 : x+\epsilon d\in \mathcal W(p)\}
\]
%
its \emph{interior} and
%
\[
  \partial \mathscr G(\mathcal W) = \mathscr G(\mathcal W)\setminus \textup{int}(\mathscr G(\mathcal W))
\]
%
its \emph{boundary}. 
%
The \emph{orientation cone} for all $(p,x)\in\partial\mathscr G(\mathcal W)$
is given by
%
\[
  \mathcal N\mathcal W(p,x) = \{d\in\mathbb R^n: x+\epsilon d \not\in \mathcal W(p)\; \forall \epsilon>0\}.
\]
\end{defi}
%
\begin{rem}
%
Notice, that definition~\ref{def:graph:of:map} is given in terms of the \emph{set variable} $x$ rather than \emph{graph variable} $(p,x)$.
%
Furthermore, notice that the orientation cone contains all directions that 
point out of the set, hence all linear combinations thereof.
%
\end{rem}
%
We state the central theorem to connect parametric convexity of a set valued 
map $\mathcal W$ with properties of its graph $\mathscr G(\mathcal W)$.
%
\begin{thm}\label{thm:p:convexity:graph}
The map $\mathcal W$ is parametrically convex iff for all $(p_1,x_1),(p_2,x_2)\in\partial\mathscr G(\mathcal W)$
with $\mathcal N\mathcal W(p_1,x_1)\cap\mathcal N\mathcal W(p_2,x_2)\neq\emptyset$ and $p_1\neq p_2$ 
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:graph:def:p:convexity}
\lambda (p_1,x_1) + (1-\lambda) (p_2,x_2) \not\in\textup{int} (\mathscr G(\mathcal W))
\end{equation}
%
holds for all $\lambda\in(0,1)$.
%
\end{thm}
%
\begin{proof}
%
Assume~\eqref{eq:graph:def:p:convexity} holds for $(p_1,x_1),(p_2,x_2)\in\partial\mathscr G(\mathcal W)$.
%
Then the Minkowski functional (see e.g.~\cite{Rudin:91}) yields $\mu_{\mathscr G(\mathcal W)}(\mathcal W(\lambda p_1 + (1-\lambda)p_2),
\lambda x_1+(1-\lambda)x_2)\geq1$,
i.e. all interpolation points lie either on the boundary or outside the set $\mathcal W(\lambda p_1+(1-\lambda)p_2)$
therefore the set of all possible interpolation points 
%
\[
\begin{split}
  \lambda \mathcal W(p_1)\oplus (1-\lambda)\mathcal W(p_2) = \{x:x=\lambda x_1 + (1-\lambda) x_2 \wedge\\ x_1\in\mathcal 
  W(p_1) \wedge x_2\in\mathcal W(p_2)\}
\end{split}
\]
%
contains the set $\mathcal W(\lambda p_1 + (1-\lambda)p_2)$.
%
Now assume $\mathcal W$ is parametrically convex but~\eqref{eq:graph:def:p:convexity} is not satisfied for 
some $(p_1,x_1),(p_2,x_2)\in\partial\mathscr G(\mathcal W)$ with $\mathcal N\mathcal W(p_1,x_1)\cap\mathcal 
N\mathcal W(p_2,x_2)\neq\emptyset$, i.e. $\lambda x_1 + (1-\lambda)x_2\in\text{int}(\mathcal W(\lambda p_1 + 
(1-\lambda)p_2)$.
%
This implies that a full dimensional ball $B_\epsilon(x ) = \{y:\| 
x-y\|<\epsilon\}$
is contained in $\mathcal W(\lambda p_1 + (1-\lambda)p_2)$, i.e. $B_\epsilon(\lambda x_1 + (1-\lambda)x_2 )\subset
\mathcal W(\lambda p_1 + (1-\lambda)p_2)$ for some $\epsilon>0$.
%
Since $\mathcal N\mathcal W(p_1,x_1)\cap\mathcal N\mathcal W(p_2,x_2)\neq\emptyset$, there exist directions 
$d\in\mathcal N\mathcal W(p_1,x_1)\cap\mathcal N\mathcal W(p_2,x_2)$ which can not be represented as $d=\lambda d_1+
(1-\lambda)d_2$ with $x_1 + \epsilon d_1\in\mathcal W(p_1)$ and $x_2  + \epsilon d_2\in\mathcal W(p_2)$, however since $B_\epsilon$ is full dimensional
all directions exist, $x+\epsilon d\in\mathcal W(\lambda p_1 + (1-\lambda)p_2)$.
%
Hence, $\mathcal W$ can not be parametrically convex.
\end{proof}
%
\begin{rem}
Notice that condition~\eqref{eq:graph:def:p:convexity} is a non-convexity condition on the graph $\mathscr G(\mathcal W)$.
%
If $\mathscr G(\mathcal W)$ is strictly convex anywhere~\eqref{eq:graph:def:p:convexity} is violated and 
$\mathcal W$ can not be parametrically convex.
\end{rem}
%
\begin{cor}
%
Let $\mathcal W(p):=\{x\in\mathbb R^n: r(p,x)\leq0\}$ define a point-to-set
map with a continuous function 
$r: \mathbb R^d \times\mathbb R^n \rightarrow \mathbb R,(p,x)\mapsto r(p,x)$, 
then $\mathcal W$ is parametrically
convex iff the function $r$ is concave in $p\in\mathbb R^d$ and convex in $x\in
\mathbb R^n$.
%
\end{cor}
%
\begin{proof}
The convexity in $x\in\mathbb R^n$ is required to satisfy the requirement that $\mathcal W(p)$ is convex
for all fixed values of $p\in\mathbb R^d$. 
%
Assume that for some region $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^d$ the function $r(\cdot,x)$ is non-concave (i.e. 
strictly convex), any convex subset $\mathcal C\subseteq\Omega$ will hence be such that $\mathscr 
G(\mathcal W)\vert_{\mathcal C}$ is a convex set.
%
In particular all lines between all $(p_1,x_1),(p_2,x_2)\in \partial\mathscr G(\mathcal W)\vert_{\mathcal C}$ will satisfy
$\lambda (p_1,x_1) + (1-\lambda) (p_2,x_2) \in\textup{int} (\mathscr G(\mathcal W))\vert_{\mathcal C}$ since
$\mathscr G(\mathcal W)\vert_{\mathcal C}$ is strictly convex in $p$.
%
This implies that $r(\cdot,x)$ can not be non-concave in any non-trivial set $\Omega\subseteq\mathbb R^d$ and still
be parametrically convex.
\end{proof}
%
\begin{cor}\label{thm:polytopic:set:not:p:convex}
The polytopic parametric set valued map $\mathcal W(p):=\{x: a_i x + b_i p\leq c_i \forall i\leq m\}$ is not parametrically convex for 
any non-trivial matrix $B$.
\end{cor}
%
\begin{proof}
The graph $\mathscr G(\mathcal W)$ is given by
%
\begin{equation*}
	\mathscr G(\mathcal W) = \{(p,x):a_i x + b_i p\leq c_i \forall i\leq m\}
\end{equation*}
%
and hence is a convex set and violates Theorem~\ref{thm:p:convexity:graph}.
\end{proof}
%
\begin{cor}\label{thm:p:convexity:PWA:set:constant:num:verts}
The non-degenerate piecewise affine polytopic parametric point-to-set valued map 
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:definition:PWA:polytopic:set:general}
  \mathcal W(p) := \left\{x: a_i x \leq \max_{k\leq l}\{b_{i,k} + C_{i,k}p\},i\leq m\right\}
\end{equation}
%
is parametrically convex iff the number of vertices $v_\kappa(p)$ and rays $r_\eta(p)$ is constant.
\end{cor}
%
\begin{proof}
For clarity this proof is divided in 3 parts:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Notice that $h_i(p) = \max_{k\leq l} \{b_{i,k} + C_{i,k}p\}$ is a multi-parametric linear program (mpLP),
its solution is a piecewise affine function $h_i(p) = b_{i,k^\ast_i} + C_{i,k^\ast_i}p$ where $k^\ast_i(p)$ is constant
inside a polytopic complex, see e.g.~\cite{spjotvold:2005}.
%
That means that there exists a finite polyhedral partitioning $\mathbb R^d = \bigcup_{j\leq t} \mathcal P_j$ with convex polyhedra 
$\mathcal P_j$ such that ${\bf{k}}^\ast\vert_{\mathcal P_j} = (k_1^\ast,\dots,k_m^\ast) = const$.
%
A standard degeneracy assumption is that in neighbouring partitions ${\bf{k}}^\ast\vert_{\mathcal P_{j_1}}$ and 
${\bf{k}}^\ast\vert_{\mathcal P_{j_2}}$ differ in exactly one element.
%
This partitioning implies that the graph $\mathscr G(\mathcal W)$ is given as a finite union of polyhedra
%
\begin{equation*}
  \mathscr G(\mathcal W) = \bigcup_{j\leq t} \left\{x: a_i x \leq b_{i,k_i^\ast} + C_{i,k_i^\ast}p,i\leq m
  \right\}\bigr\vert_{\mathcal P_{j}}
\end{equation*}
%
But this implies that if the number of vertices or rays changes inside any partition $\mathcal P_j$ then $\mathscr
G(\mathcal W)\vert_{\mathcal P_j}$ is a strictly convex polyhedron and corollary~\ref{thm:polytopic:set:not:p:convex} applies.
%
\item Our attention hence is concentrated to the boundaries of the partitions $\mathcal P_j$.
%
These are the points $\mathcal P_{j_1} \cap \mathcal P_{j_2}$ where some mpLP changes its solution, i.e. 
$\left(b_{i,k_i^\ast} + C_{i,k_{j_1}^\ast} p\right)\big\vert_{\mathcal P_{j_1}} = 
\left(b_{i,k_{j_2}^\ast} + C_{i,k_{j_2}^\ast} p\right)\big\vert_{\mathcal P_{j_2}}$.
%
Notice that a vertex $v_\kappa(p)$ is given by \emph{active} and \emph{inactive} inequalities, i.e. $\mathcal A_\kappa(p)$ and
$\mathcal I_\kappa(p) = \{1,\dots,m\}\setminus\mathcal A_\kappa(p)$ respectively.
%
\begin{equation*}\begin{split}
  a_i v_\kappa(p) &= b_{i,k_i^\ast} + C_{i,k_i^\ast} p \quad\forall i\in\mathcal A_\kappa(p)\\
  a_i v_\kappa(p) &< b_{i,k_i^\ast} + C_{i,k_i^\ast} p \quad\forall i\in\mathcal I_\kappa(p)
\end{split}\end{equation*}
%
In order for the number of vertices to change, there must be a hyperplane $fp=g$, such that the number of vertices for $fp<g$ is 
$N$ and for $fp>g$ is at least $N+1$.
%
It follows from the previous discussion that $\{p:fp=g\} = \textup{aff}\{\mathcal P_{j_1}\cap\mathcal P_{j_2}\}$ for some $j_1\neq j_2$.
%
For vertices $v_{\kappa_1}(p)$ and $v_{\kappa_2}(p)$ to merge the index sets $\mathcal A_{\kappa_1}(p)$ and 
$\mathcal A_{\kappa_2}(p)$ have to differ in only one 
element, i.e. $\mathcal A_{\kappa_1}(p) = \mathcal J\cup \{s\}$ and $\mathcal A_{\kappa_2}(p) = \mathcal J\cup\{u\}$ for $fp>g$.
%
Furthermore, for $p$ with $fp\leq g$ we have $v_{\kappa_1}(p)=v_{\kappa_2}(p)$, this implies $\mathcal A_{\kappa_1}(p) = 
\mathcal A_{\kappa_2}(p)$.
%
Since only one alteration of the active index set is considered (due to non-degeneracy assumptions), the active set 
$\mathcal A_{\kappa_1}(p) = \mathcal A_{\kappa_2}(p) = \mathcal J \cup \{s,u\}$.
%
Hence on the hyperplane $fp=g$ both, the maximising index ${\bf{k}}^\ast(p)$ and the active index sets $\mathcal A_{\kappa_1}(p)$ 
and $\mathcal A_{\kappa_2}(p)$ change, which is means the problem is degenerate.
%
\item In order for the degenerate graph $\mathscr G(\mathcal W)$ to be parametrically convex the overdetermined 
vertex $v_{\kappa_1}(p)=v_{\kappa_2}(p)$ have to be identical, in particular their dependence on $p$ has to be identical.
%
This can be expressed with the implicit function theorem:
%
\begin{equation*}\begin{split}
  \frac{d}{dp}\left(  A_{\mathcal J\cup \{s\}} v_{\kappa_1}(p) - b_{\mathcal J\cup \{s\}} - C_{\mathcal J\cup \{s\},{\bf{k}}^\ast} p\right) &= 0\\
  \frac{d}{dp}\left(  A_{\mathcal J\cup \{u\}} v_{\kappa_2}(p) - b_{\mathcal J\cup \{u\}} - C_{\mathcal J\cup \{u\},{\bf{k}}^\ast} p\right) &= 0
\end{split}\end{equation*}
%
which leads to 
%
\begin{equation*}\begin{split}
  A_{\mathcal J\cup \{s\}} \frac{dv_{\kappa}}{dp} &= C_{\mathcal J\cup \{s\},{\bf{k}}^\ast}\\
  A_{\mathcal J\cup \{u\}} \frac{dv_{\kappa}}{dp} &= C_{\mathcal J\cup \{u\},{\bf{k}}^\ast}
\end{split}\end{equation*}
%
since we can assume that the inequalities are non-redundant for some right hand side, we obtain that 
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:derivative:condition:on:index:sets}
  \frac{dv_\kappa}{dp} = A_{\mathcal J\cup \{s\}}^{-1}C_{\mathcal J\cup \{s\},{\bf{k}}^\ast} = 
  A_{\mathcal J\cup \{u\}}^{-1}C_{\mathcal J\cup \{u\},{\bf{k}}^\ast}
\end{equation}
%
has to hold for the degenerate graph to remain parametrically convex.
%
Notice that~\eqref{eq:derivative:condition:on:index:sets} is again a degenerate condition, since arbitrarily small perturbations
will produce different behaviour.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}
%
\begin{rem}
Corollary~\ref{thm:p:convexity:PWA:set:constant:num:verts} is essential for numerical examples, as it can be reformulated to:
%
The set valued map defined by~\eqref{eq:definition:PWA:polytopic:set:general} is non-degenerate and parametrically convex iff 
it has a constant number of vertices throughout the parameter space~$X$.
%
Since the map is continuous it is sufficient to verify this at the vertices of the parameter space.
%
\end{rem}
%
In order to determine MRPI sets we need to be able to calculate the Pontryagin difference between sets, hence we introduce
the following.
%
\begin{defi}[Parametric Pontryagin Difference]\label{def:parametric:pontryagin:difference}
  Let $S\subseteq X$ and let $\mathcal W:X\to\mathscr P(X)$ be a continuous point-to-set map such that
  $\mathcal W(p)$ is convex for all $p\in X$, then the \emph{parametric Pontryagin difference} 
  $S\ominus \mathcal W(S)$ is 
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:definition:parametric:pontryagin:difference}
    S\ominus \mathcal W(S) = \left\{x\in X: \{x\} \oplus \mathcal W(x)\subseteq S\right\},
  \end{equation}
  where $\mathcal W(S)$ denotes the image of $S$ under the map $\mathcal W$. 
\end{defi}
%
For the parametric Pontryagin difference of a convex set and a parametrically convex map we 
have the following result.
%
\begin{thm}\label{thm:convexity:of:pontryagin:difference}
  Let $S\subseteq X$ be a convex set and let $\mathcal W:X\rightarrow\mathscr P(X)$ be a parametrically convex point-to-set
  map such that $\mathcal W(p)$ is convex for all $p\in X$, then $S\ominus \mathcal W(S)$ is convex.
\end{thm}
%
\begin{proof}
To prove the convexity of $ Z :=  S\ominus \mathcal W( S)$ we pick any $z_1,z_2\in Z$, then
by definition of the parametric Pontryagin difference, we have
%
\begin{equation}
  \{z_i\} \oplus \mathcal W(z_i) \subseteq S,\; i=1,2.
\end{equation}
%
To see that $ Z$ is convex we show that line segments between
all possible $z_1$ and $z_2$ are subsets of $ Z$, i.e.~for all $\lambda \in [0,1]$,
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
  \{ \lambda z_1 + (1-&\lambda)z_2
  \}\oplus \mathcal W\left( \lambda z_1 + (1-\lambda)z_2\right)\\
  \subseteq&\left\{ \lambda z_1 + (1-\lambda)z_2
  \right\}\oplus \lambda \mathcal W(z_1) \oplus (1-\lambda)
  \mathcal W(z_2)\\
  \subseteq &\lambda\underbrace{(\{z_1\}\oplus \mathcal W(z_1))}_{\subseteq S}\oplus
  (1-\lambda)\underbrace{(\{z_2\}\oplus \mathcal W(z_2))}_{\subseteq S}\\
  \subseteq& Z
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
%
where the last inclusion follows from the convexity of $\mathcal S$.
\end{proof}
%
Theorem~\ref{thm:convexity:of:pontryagin:difference} only gives us the convexity of the parametric
Pontryagin difference, in the following we will see that the parametric Pontryagin difference between
a polyhedral set and a piecewise affine polytopic parametric set is polyhedral itself.
